# colorpicker
a pure JavaScript photoshop style colorpicker

This is my second JavaScript project.

2 years ago, I wanted to write a color picker. There are good colorpicker's project on github, but it's code by React. I tried to learn React and gave up quickly and the project stopped because of it.

 Recently I started restarting the project and finally it took almost 2 months to complete it.I learned a lot from the project. For example how to use function and how to change variables.

The difficulty of the project is to control the position of the cursor and the conversion of the cursor and the value by adjusting the values of RGB and HEX.

Thanks my friends for helping me to resolve that problems.
